# KissOfLifeVisualizer

A TouchDesigner-based music visualizer built around a selected section of **"Kiss of Life" by Sade**. This project explores reactive visuals synced to the song, using TouchDesigner networks to translate audio features into motion, color, and form.

This repository exists mainly for experimentation, learning, and creative tweaking. Feel free to open it up, break things, and reshape the visuals to your taste.

## What This Is

* A **TouchDesigner `.toe` file** that visualizes part of *Kiss of Life* by Sade
* Audio-reactive visuals driven by the song’s dynamics
* Designed as a creative / artistic project rather than a polished product

I essentially made this as a personal visualizer experiment and decided to share it for others who want to explore or modify it.

## Requirements

To run or edit this project, you’ll need:

* **TouchDesigner** (Free or Commercial)

  * Download from: [https://derivative.ca](https://derivative.ca)
* A machine capable of real-time graphics rendering (GPU recommended)

> Note: The free version of TouchDesigner should be sufficient for viewing and basic tweaking.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

You can either clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/KissofLifeVisualizer.git
```

Or download it as a ZIP from GitHub and extract it locally.

---

### 2. Open the Project in TouchDesigner

1. Launch **TouchDesigner**
2. Open the provided `.toe` file
3. Make sure the audio file path is valid (see note below)

---

### 3. Audio Setup (Important)

For copyright reasons, the **song file itself may not be included** in this repository.

To make the visualizer work:

1. Obtain a local copy of *Kiss of Life* by Sade
2. Place it in the expected directory **or**
3. Update the **Audio File In CHOP** (or equivalent node) to point to your local audio file

Once the audio is linked correctly, the visuals should react automatically.

## Tweaking & Customization

If you want to experiment:

* Dive into the **CHOPs** to adjust audio sensitivity
* Modify **TOPs** for color, texture, and post-processing
* Change **parameters** to alter timing, intensity, or motion
* Swap the audio input to experiment with other tracks

This project is meant to be opened up and explored — nothing is off-limits.

## Notes

* This is a creative project, not a commercial tool
* Visual behavior may depend on frame rate and hardware
* Results can vary slightly across systems
* [I ran this on a HP Spectre]
